This program uses data to draw patterns in stock market data
From these line patterns I used k-means clustering to categorize the patterns 
With these categories of patterns I analyze if some categories tend to lean toward the price either going up or down after the pattern is spotted
The last part is the trading algorithm which trade uses identified patterns that lead to predicted price movement

What can I add to this later
- Machine learning that takes the pattern category, and additional data like volume data and rsi etc. 
- I can also alter the trading algorithm to employ risk management strategies
- Need to get more data for the categorizing
- Could even use machine learning with patterns and hedge pressure
